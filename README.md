# Connect4

The well-known game called connect4 has been solved in 1988 by James Dow Allen by using a brute fore method. The solved conclusion is first player win with perfect play. I created this bot to see how far I can go in making an AI that uses the AI algortim Negamax with alpha-beta pruning and still finishes the calculations within a decent amount of time.
